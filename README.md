WoW 3.3.5 addon.

No settings UI yet, but some values can be adjusted via constants in the .lua file.

Displays the following:

1) Time left until body resurrection

4) Your current zone
5) Dungeon difficulty
6) Remaining PvP flag time (shown if under 5 minutes)

9) Latency (same as shown in the game menu tooltip, updates ~every 30 sec)
10) RTT (Round-trip time) â€” a more accurate ping using addon messages (updates rapidly; good for spotting real connection issues)
